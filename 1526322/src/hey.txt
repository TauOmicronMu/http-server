  Hey! I'm Tom! 
  I'm a Software Developer/Engineer, Event Organiser, Analyst and Developer Evangelist with prior industry experience. 
  I'm ideally looking for a year-long industrial placement at a friendly tech company who value personal development 
and would really let me utilise my technical, organisational and interpersonal skills. 
Now we've gotten that out of the way (I know it was a bit of a mouthful...)
  I'm also a keen musician (pianist & singer), and really enjoy both performing and composing in my spare time. 
  I've spent far too long already on this site, and I keep getting nerd sniped by people who are suggesting 
cool things to implement... like vim... and vim... ...
  If you're reading this - say hey! Chuck me a message on Twitter - I'm @TauOmicronMu!
